  "readme": "# jsreport\r\n[![NPM Version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/jsreport.svg?style=flat-square)](https://npmjs.com/package/jsreport)\r\n[![NPM Downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/jsreport.svg?style=flat-square)](https://npmjs.com/package/jsreport)\r\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jsreport/jsreport.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jsreport/jsreport)\r\n\r\n**Open source platform for designing and rendering various reports.**\r\n\r\njsreport is a reporting sever which lets developers define reports using  javascript templating engines (like jsrender or handlebars). It supports various report output formats like html, pdf, excel and others.  It also includes advanced reporting features like user management, REST API, scheduling, designer or sending emails.\r\n\r\nFor more informations about the platform please visit http://jsreport.net\r\n\r\n## Production installation\r\nsee [http://jsreport.net/downloads](http://jsreport.net/downloads)\r\n\r\n## Development\r\nTo be able to install and start jsreport on your development machine you need to do following.\r\n\r\n1. install nodejs\r\n2. clone this repository\r\n3. npm install\r\n4. npm start\r\n\r\nYou may find installation troubleshooting guide specific for your platform [here](https://github.com/jsreport/docs/tree/master/installation).\r\n\r\nSee [Gruntfile.js](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) for build automation options.\r\n\r\n###Environemnts\r\njsreport adapts to `production` and `development` nodejs environments. Difference is that in `production` environment you get javascript files combined and minified for fast web application startup opposite to `development` environment where you get all js files individually what makes debugging easier. Second difference is that in `production` environment jsreport use `prod.config.json` as configuration file opposite to `dev.config.json` in `development.\r\n\r\nTo change environment use cmd `set NODE_ENV=development` or use options your IDE provides. If you don't specify node environment jsreport assumes production as default.\r\n\r\n###Configurations\r\njsreport loads `dev.config.json` or `prod.config.json` configuration file on start up based on nodejs environment. If configuration file is not found, jsreport creates default configuration file from `example.config.json`.\r\n\r\nSee [config](https://github.com/jsreport/jsreport/blob/master/config.md) documentation for details.\r\n\r\n###Tests\r\n\r\n **grunt test** - start tests with file system based db (neDb), no mongo needed\r\n\r\n **grunt test-mongo** - start tests with mongo db, mongodb must be running on localhost\r\n\r\n **grunt test-all** - start tests with nedb and then once again with mongo (used with travis CI)\r\n\r\n **grunt test-integration** - start all tests with nedb including integration tests,  needs java, fop and phantomjs running\r\n\r\n## Contributions\r\nThe easiest way how to contribute to jsreport open source community is to implement jsreport extension. Pull requests to this core repository are also welcome.\r\n\r\n**Check the tutorial for [writing custom extensions](http://jsreport.net/learn/custom-extension)**\r\n\r\n##Roadmap\r\nThe following features are planned for Q2 and Q3. \r\n\r\n### Template designer in CKEditor\r\nThe current embedded jsreport editor is way too complex for non developers. We would like to create some plugins into CKEditor and improve end user experience when editing simple template. This should work great with pdf reports but for interactive html reports we need to find a different solution.\r\n\r\n###Anonymous statistics\r\nCollect anonymous usage statistics from jsreport studio. This won't have any value for the jsreport users, but great value for us. \r\n\r\n###Client application\r\nWe would like to provide a consumer web based application.  Where user can login and browse reports. The client application should be very responsive and display well on all kind of client devices from small phones to desktops. \r\n\r\n###Phantom pdf improvements\r\nThe most requested features are support for Table of Contents and click-able \r\nlinks. This is currently work in progress in phantomjs, when it is merged we will try to make it working in jsreport as well.\r\n\r\n###Template history extension\r\nExtension tracking changes in templates and capable to switch back to one of the previous versions.\r\n\r\n**Missing a feature? Submit a feature request.**\r\n\r\n## License \r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Jan Blaha &lt;jan.blaha at hotmail.com&gt;\r\n\r\n\r\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\r\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\r\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\r\nversion 3.0 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\r\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\r\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\r\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
